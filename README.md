## Match Game

This is meant to be a simple match game that is built using React. The basic game will have eight cards that must be matched. You are given three chances to match all of the cards properly. If you don't you fail, if you do however, you win! This game is based on the match game from New Super Mario Bros. 

### To Run

Simply use

```bash
yarn install 
```
 Then
 
 ```bash
 yarn start
 ```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
